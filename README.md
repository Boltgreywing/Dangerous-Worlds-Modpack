# Dangerous Worlds

This is a modpack for Minecraft 1.12.2 and is a bit on the challenging side.
The mobs in this game will seek out your shelters and try to destory them.
This also applies to the villages as well. There is also more stones
introduced into the world to make the world look better. There is some
vehicles you can use provided that you can survive the depths of the mines.
If your looking for an additional challenge try playing the game without
structures enabled and try to design your own style minecraft dungeons with
a bit of help from the cheat menu to do so.

The current version is 3.0.
